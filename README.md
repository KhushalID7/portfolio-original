# 🌟 Hello and Welcome!

Hey there! 👋

This is **my personal portfolio website** — a small corner of the internet where I showcase my work, skills, and ideas.

It’s built with **Next.js** and **TypeScript**, styled with a **Tailwind-inspired setup**, and sprinkled with reusable components and custom hooks. Think of it as a **living resume** — simple, fast, and a little bit personal.

## 💡 What You’ll Find Here

This site isn’t just a collection of pages — it’s a cleanly organized codebase that keeps everything in its right place:

- 🏠 **Pages & Layout** → live inside `app/`
- 🧩 **Reusable Components** → found in `components/` (and subfolder `components/ui/`)
- 🪄 **Custom Hooks & Utilities** → tucked neatly into `hooks/` and `lib/`
- 🖼️ **Static Assets** → all stored in `public/`
- 🎨 **Global Styles** → managed via `styles/`

So whether you’re exploring as a **developer**, **designer**, or just a **curious visitor**, everything’s easy to follow.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack at a Glance

Here’s what powers the site:

- **Framework:** Next.js (App Router)
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind-ish setup with PostCSS
- **Package Manager:** pnpm (fast & efficient)
- **Runtime:** Node.js (v18+ recommended)

Simple tools. Clean design. Smooth experience.

## 🚀 Getting Started (for Developers)

If you’d like to run or tweak this project locally, here’s how you do it on Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start the local dev server
pnpm dev

# Build for production
pnpm build

# Run the production build
pnpm start
```

If you don't use `pnpm`, you can run the equivalent with `npm` or `yarn` — but `pnpm` is what this repo was built with.

If you need `pnpm`:

```powershell
npm i -g pnpm
```

### Keeping it simple — scripts

Open `package.json` to see the exact scripts. Expect at least:

- `dev` — local dev server
- `build` — create a production build
- `start` — run the built app

### Notes about environment

- Recommended Node: 18 or newer.
- If the app needs any secrets, put them in a `.env.local` (not committed).
- `.gitignore` is present — make sure `node_modules/`, `.next/` and env files are ignored before committing.

### Want to put this on GitHub?

Simple sequence (PowerShell):

```powershell
git init
git add .
git commit -m "chore: initial commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

If you'd like, I can initialize and push this for you — just tell me the remote URL and I'll run the commands.

### Extras / ideas

- Add a `LICENSE` (MIT is a common choice).
- Add screenshots or a short demo GIF to the README.
- Add a short CONTRIBUTING.md if you want others to send PRs.

That's it — short, friendly, and ready to run. Want me to tweak the tone more (even more casual, or more professional)? Or go ahead and initialize a GitHub repo for you? Tell me which and I'll do it.
